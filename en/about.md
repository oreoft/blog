## About Me

A programmer who graduated in 2020 and is currently in my odyssey era, aiming to work hard and become an outstanding developer.

I love coding, technology, and learning. I enjoy that feeling of making the world obey my commands with code. Coding makes my logic tighter and my thinking more flexible. I like the design journey from “0” to “1”, and I also like carving that “1” into “∞” like an artist.

I also love hardware, tinkering, and knowledge. I’m amazed by those tiny magical silicon blocks that represent the pinnacle of human ingenuity, and I’m in awe of how fast technology evolves and how many possibilities it brings. Browsing for “junk” on Xianyu is a hobby outside of work. I enjoy building PCs, Hackintosh, soft routers, and NAS. I’m extremely sensitive to performance specs—I may not need it, but you can’t be without it.

I love life too—myself, and the unknown. I admire the charm of classical poetry and look up to Su Dongpo’s spirit. I also long for poetry and distant horizons. Walking along the road, life is short—so let’s try new fire with new tea. Enjoy poetry and wine while we’re still young.

## Why I Started This Blog

Building a blog is something I’ve always wanted to do but never actually did, because since high school I’ve benefited a lot from other experts’ blogs. So I made a promise to myself: someday I must have my own blog. Later in college, I didn’t have the motivation to write and kept it in my mind—honestly, the main reason was that college was just too much fun.... Then preparing for the CS graduate entrance exam took up a ton of time (and damn it, I still didn’t get in, sob). Now that I’ve been working for a while, I’ve realized that for technical folks, a blog is still really important. With new thoughts piled onto old ones, I wrote this About page—does this count as my first post?

Besides that original seed in my heart, I’ve also summarized a few reasons for writing a blog—also as a reminder to myself to keep going, not waste time, and stay true to my original intention:

**1. Strengthen memory and improve my ability to explain things clearly**

> I’m a perfectionist—maybe a fake one... because I’m pretty messy. But jokes aside, my “perfection” is about doing things in a way that makes me feel comfortable. I have extremely strict requirements for layout, formatting, the content of messages I send to others, whether screenshots include an *Alpha* channel, and so on. This means before writing a blog post, I’ll spend more time expressing my thoughts. And before I can express them, I need to reorganize and review the content—understand it again, absorb it again, and sort out the structure and logic.
>
> *A lot of the time, you think you understand something, but when you try to explain it again or write it down with pen and paper, you suddenly don’t know where to start.*

**2. The spirit of sharing on the internet**

> By sharing, I can get direct and fast feedback. It’s not material—it’s spiritual. I get pretty addicted to that kind of spiritual return. No utilitarianism, just like.

**3. Record the little bits of growth**

> When I wrote this About page, I had just graduated this year. I was working and learning at a startup in Wuhan. I don’t know what the future will look like, but I don’t want to look back one day and find I left no record at all.
>
> I think everyone has had experiences like this: after a long time, you suddenly look back at what you did or said before and feel it was incredibly stupid. WeChat even introduced the “visible for three days” feature to save you from embarrassment. But it’s exactly those stupid years that make us grow—constantly adjusting our position and correcting our mistakes along the way.
>
> By the way, somehow a quarter of my life is almost gone. Sometimes it’s kind of nostalgic to look at old records—even though at the time I felt nothing. It’s a pity I didn’t leave more records in high school and college.

**4. Explore more unknown worlds**

> The world isn’t limited to my home, my company, or my social circle. I think the internet is a parallel space where I can experience a much bigger world. By writing a blog, I know there are many people out there just like me—reading blogs, writing blogs, together with me. In this parallel space, these people and this knowledge are waiting for me somewhere in a corner of the world.

**5. Help and give back to people who want help** 

> I intentionally put this last, and it’s also what I encounter most at work—the source that motivates me to write something each time. As a newbie exploring unknown knowledge areas, I often get my face full of dust. Sometimes I can’t even set up the environment. When I’m lucky, I quickly run into a great article that solves my difficulties and frustrations. But most of the time, I can’t find an article that I can understand just right.
>
> If I find an article that solves my problem, I’m grateful—and I’ll write a blog post as a knowledge return, passing the technical baton. If I can’t find an article that solves my problem, and I manage to solve it myself, I’ll share what I learned—just in case someone out there is like me and couldn’t find an article that addresses this issue.

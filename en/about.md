## About me.

I am currently a graduate student in a computer-related field. I love keeping records, English is not my first language, but I'm trying to write in English! My goal is to become a good developer.

I love programming, I love technology, I love learning. I like to indulge in the feeling of using code to make the world obey my orders, coding makes my logic more meticulous and my thinking more flexible. Like from 'zero' to 'one' design process, but also like a master artist like this 'one' carefully carved into '∞'.

I also love hardware, tossing, and knowledge. Surprised at the highest crystallization of human wisdom on behalf of the small magical silicon square, sighing technology is changing rapidly to give us endless possibilities, in the ebay poking a piece of garbage is considered to be a hobby after work, like to DIY Computer, Hackintosh, SoftRouter, NAS. performance parameters party is very sensitive, I can not, but you can not do without.

I also love life, love themselves, love the unknown. The rhyme of ancient poetry, worship Su Dongpo's wind. The same yearning for poetry and faraway places, walking in the road, life is short, and will be a new fire to try new tea. Poetry and wine while the year is young.

## Original intention

Build a blog this can be really I have always wanted to do but did not do things before, because from high school on in other's blog in a lot of benefits. So had set up a flag, later must also have their own blog 

In addition to the initial seed in my heart, I summarized a few reasons for blogging, and also to tell myself that I hope I can not be deserted, and stick to writing blog content and not forgetting the original intention:

**1. Enhancement of memorization and ability to explain things clearly**

> I'm a perfectionist I'm perfect in the sense that I do things that make me feel good about myself in my own mind, and I'm extremely strict about typography, formatting, the content of messages I send to others, screenshots with or without *Alpha* channels, and the like. This makes me take more time to express my thoughts before I blog, and before I express my thoughts I need to reorganize and review the content, re-understand and re-absorb it and clear my thoughts and logic.
>
> *Often times a lot of things you think you understand, but when you rephrase them or re-record them with pen and paper, you feel clueless.*

**2. The Sharing Spirit of the Internet**

> By sharing, I get a direct and quick return that is not material but spiritual. I will be very addicted to this spiritual reward, which has nothing to do with utilitarianism，just like。

**3. Record the growing up**

> I should still be in grad school in Chicago when I write this about, and I don't know what the future holds, but I don't want me to look back without a little record left behind。
>
> Each of us should have a similar experience: after a long time suddenly look back at what they used to do and say, will feel very silly, but because of these silly years so that we continue to grow, in the process of our growth continue to correct their own position, to correct their own mistakes.
>
> By the way，Suddenly a quarter of my life is almost gone, and sometimes it's kinda nostalgic to see the finished records, even though it was pretty senseless at the time, and I regret that I didn't keep more records in high school and college.。

**4. Explore more unknown worlds**

> The world is not just limited to my home, my company, my circle of friends, I feel that the Internet is a parallel space where I can experience a bigger world. Through blogging, I know that there are many other people in the world who read blogs, write blogs and are with me as I am. In this parallel space these people and knowledge are waiting for me somewhere in the world.。

**5. Helping and giving back to those who want to get help**

> I put this point to the end on purpose, this is the source that I encountered the most in my work and every time it motivates me to write something. As a newcomer, exploring an unknown field of knowledge, often get mad, sometimes the environment is not well-built, and when I am lucky, I can soon come across a very good article to solve my difficulties and troubles. But most of the time I don't find an article that I can understand.
>
> I came across an article that just solved my problem and I'm grateful for it, I'm going to write a blog about it as a knowledge give back and let the technology take over. I didn't come across an article that just solved my problem, and if I do, I'm going to share my knowledge and fill in the blanks in case someone else is like me and doesn't come across an article that solves the problem。
